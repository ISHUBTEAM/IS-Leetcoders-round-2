# 11. Water Bottles

There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.  


The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.  


Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return the **maximum** number of water bottles you can drink.  

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3`  

**Output:** `13`  

**Explanation:** `You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.`

**Example 2:**

<img width="1053" height="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e48ddd13-0737-4484-9fba-e3110ccb3da8" />

**Input:** `numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4`  

**Output:** `19`  

**Explanation:** `You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.`

 ---

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
- `2 <= numExchange <= 100`
